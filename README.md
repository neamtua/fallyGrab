# fallyGrab
=========

A fully customizable screenshot application
http://fallygrab.com

## About
I've made this application last year while I was trying to learn a bit of C# in my spare time. It only works on Windows.
I've been using it daily ever since, mostly uploading screenshots to FTP.
It takes fullscreen or region screenshots and it uploads them to a various number of services (FTP, Facebook, Dropbox, Imageshack) and it also gives you the possibility to create a short URL using the goo.gl service.

## Information
The solution includes two projects, the main one called **fallyGrab** and another project I made for the notifications used by the software, called **fallyToast**.
Make sure to add a reference to the DLL generated by **fallyToast** to **fallyGrab** in order for it to compile.
You will also need to create a settings file in the **fallyGrab** project called api.settings with 3 string settings, application scope, named **googl**, **facebook** and **imageshack** where you need to add your API keys for these services.

## Disclaimer
The code is a mess. It could use quite a bit of refactoring. I'm a PHP programmer, C# is not my main cup of tea.
Feel free to add to this project as you see fit.
